## `/rails-authentication`

End-to-end authentication setup using Rails 8's built-in generator.

Walks through the full auth stack in phases:

1. **Discovery** — clarifies requirements before touching code (sign-up flow, email verification, organizations, roles, OAuth, 2FA)
2. **Generator** — runs `bin/rails generate authentication` and explains what it creates
3. **Sign-up** — adds `RegistrationsController` and the registration form (the generator omits this)
4. **Email verification** — `generates_token_for :email_verification` with configurable access gating
5. **Accounts / Organizations** — `Account` + `Membership` join model for multi-tenant B2B apps
6. **Roles & Permissions** — role stored on `Membership`, with guidance on when to reach for Pundit
7. **Invitations** — signed token invite flow for existing and new users
8. **OAuth / Social Login** — OmniAuth + `ConnectedAccount` model

Reference docs are included for 2FA, API tokens, session management, rate limiting, and account settings.

## `/rails-seo`

Audits and improves SEO for Ruby on Rails applications.

Covers nine areas against Joost de Valk's SEO framework, ported to Ruby:

| Concern | Gem / technique |
|---|---|
| Head metadata | `meta-tags` |
| Structured data | `schema_dot_org` + custom `Seo::Graph` helper |
| Sitemaps | `sitemap_generator` |
| Open Graph images | `grover` + `image_processing` + Active Storage |
| IndexNow | Custom Faraday client in a Solid Queue job |
| llms.txt & schema endpoints | Custom controllers |
| Agent discovery | `.well-known/` endpoints, MCP server card |

Works for both Sitepress content sites (`app/content/pages/`) and standard ActiveRecord apps.

## `/rails-conductor-setup-config`

Configures a Rails app to work inside [Conductor](https://conductor.sh) workspaces.

Creates or merges the minimum set of files needed so each workspace boots on its own assigned port:

- `conductor.json` — tells Conductor which scripts to run
- `bin/conductor-setup` — symlinks `.env`, credentials, storage, and `.bundle` from the repo root
- `script/server` — starts the dev server with `CONDUCTOR_PORT` → `PORT` → `3000` fallback
- `config/initializers/default_host.rb` — makes URL generation and mailer links respect `PORT`
- `config/puma.rb` — merges in the port binding if missing

All edits are additive — existing working configs are never replaced wholesale.

## `/pgsync`

Sets up `bin/pgsync-tunnel` to sync production Postgres data to your local dev database via an SSH tunnel. Designed for apps hosted on [Hatchbox.io](https://hatchbox.io).

Creates four files:

| File | Committed | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/pgsync-tunnel` | yes | SSH tunnel + pgsync wrapper |
| `.pgsync.yml` | yes | Tables and groups to sync (no secrets) |
| `.env.pgsync.example` | yes | Template for teammates |
| `.env.pgsync` | no (gitignored) | Real credentials |

Usage after setup:

```sh
bin/pgsync-tunnel              # sync everything in .pgsync.yml
bin/pgsync-tunnel users        # one table
bin/pgsync-tunnel group:core   # a named group
```

The tunnel opens automatically before pgsync runs and closes when it finishes.

## `/cloudflare`

Audits and configures a Rails app to work correctly behind Cloudflare's DNS proxy.

Triggers on: Cloudflare, CDN proxy, session cookies broken, CSRF invalid, wrong IP in logs, Set-Cookie stripped, Rack::Attack not working, or "secure flag missing".

Covers six fix areas in order:

| Fix | Problem | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| SSL Mode | Flexible SSL breaks cookies + CSRF | Switch to Full (Strict) |
| assume_ssl | Rails sees HTTP even behind TLS | `config.assume_ssl = true` (Rails 7.1+) |
| Real client IP | CF edge IP in logs, Rack::Attack bypassed | `cloudflare-rails` gem |
| Cache Rules | Set-Cookie stripped, users can't log in | Audit CF cache rules for dynamic paths |
| Cookie attributes | Missing Secure/SameSite flags | Verify with `curl -sI` |
| CSRF failures | InvalidAuthenticityToken on form POST | SSL mode + email obfuscation off |

Reference docs included for SSL modes, IP spoofing, session cookies, and CSRF.

## `/worktrees`

Creates and deletes isolated git worktrees for a Rails app using the [FastTravelAS/rails-worktree](https://github.com/FastTravelAS/rails-worktree) gem.

Each worktree gets its own development + test databases, copied config (`.env`, `database.yml`, credentials, `node_modules`), migrations, and seeds — so you can work multiple branches in parallel without database collisions.

First confirms `bin/worktree` exists. If missing, it adds `gem "rails-worktree"` to the Gemfile's `:development` group, runs `bundle install` (which generates the binstub), and verifies `config/database.yml` reads `DATABASE_NAME_DEVELOPMENT` / `DATABASE_NAME_TEST`.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `bin/worktree feature-x` | Create a worktree from the current branch |
| `bin/worktree feature-x main` | Create from an explicit base branch |
| `bin/worktree --close feature-x` | Drop databases, remove dir, delete branch (from main repo) |
| `bin/worktree --close` | Same, run from inside the worktree |

## `/rails-upgrade`

Guides a Rails app through version upgrades one hop at a time, using the official Rails upgrade guide bundled as per-version reference files.

Detects the current version from `Gemfile.lock` (and whether `config.load_defaults` lags behind it), plans the hop path, then for each hop: bump the Gemfile pin → `bundle update rails` → `bin/rails app:update` → apply that hop's breaking changes → run tests → flip framework defaults one at a time → commit.

Reference docs (verbatim chapters from the official guide, v8.1.2):

| Hop | Reference |
|---|---|
| General advice | Test coverage, Ruby versions, the update task, framework defaults |
| 5.2 → 6.0 | Zeitwerk, Webpacker, force_ssl, purpose cookies, Action Cable JS |
| 6.0 → 6.1 | `ActiveModel::Error`, HTTPS redirect status, callback args |
| 6.1 → 7.0 | Zeitwerk required, Sprockets optional, `AS::Dependencies` removal |
| 7.0 → 7.1 | secret_key_base path, cache format, autoload paths, encryption |
| 7.1 → 7.2 | Active Job queue adapter config, `alias_attribute` |
| 7.2 → 8.0 | Minimal changes |
| 8.0 → 8.1 | `schema.rb` column sorting |
